# Flex - A Movie and Series Streaming Platform

Welcome to the Flex project! Follow the steps below to set up and run the Flex movie and series streaming platform on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your computer:

1. WampServer: A local server environment for Windows.
    Installation Instructions
    Download the Project

Download the zip file containing the Flex project from the GitHub repository.

Extract the Files

Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to a location of your choice on your computer.

Set Up WampServer

If you haven’t already installed WampServer, download and install it from the WampServer website.
After installation, start WampServer. You should see a WampServer icon in the system tray.
Place the Project Files

Navigate to the installation directory of WampServer. By default, this is located at C:\wamp64\ (or C:\wamp\ if you are using an older version).
Open the www folder within the WampServer installation directory.
Copy the extracted project folder and paste it into the www folder.
Access the Project

Open your web browser and type http://localhost/[your_project_folder_name] in the address bar, replacing [your_project_folder_name] with the name of the project folder you placed in the www directory.
You should now see the Flex movie and series streaming platform running on your local server.
Additional Information
Ensure that WampServer is running and that the server icon in the system tray is green. If it’s red or orange, there might be an issue with the server setup or configuration.
If you encounter any issues, check the WampServer logs or project documentation for troubleshooting tips.
